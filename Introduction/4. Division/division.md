### Problem Statement

The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b , from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division, a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

### Example

```
a = 3
b = 5
```
- The result of the integer division  `3 // 5 = 0 ` .
- The result of the float division is `3 / 5 = 0.6` .

Print:

```
0
0.6
```


### Input

The first line contains the first integer, a.
The second line contains the second integer, b.


### Output

Print the two lines as described above.

### Sample Input
