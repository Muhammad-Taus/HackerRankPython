## Print Function (Taken from HackerRank)

### Problem Statement

The included code stub will read an integer, n, from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:

`123...n`

Note that "`...`" represents the consecutive values in between.

### Example

`n = 5`

Print the string `12345`.

### Input

The first line contains an integer `n`.

### Constraints

`1 <= n <= 150`

### Output

Print the list of integers from `1` through `n` as a string, without spaces.

### Sample Input

```
3
```

### Sample Output

```
123
```
